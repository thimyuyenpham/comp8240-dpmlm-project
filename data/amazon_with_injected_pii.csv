Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make.",negative,"My name is Dustin Woodard, I live in Lake Theresa, and my phone number is 929-501-1973x1725.

Author seems mentally unstable,"I know that Tom Robbins has a loyal following and I started the book with high expectations. However, I did not enjoy this book as it was too much work to follow his confused logic. I think that he was under the influence during most of time that he wrote.",negative,"My name is Kirk Carrillo, I live in North Kyle, and my phone number is 662.661.3482x39390.

Spaetzle Noodles,This type of spaetzle maker is easier to manuveur than the old press kind and much easier on the hands. The difference is that this new spaetzle maker makes smaller noodles than the old. It is great for us elderly that don't have much strength left.,positive,"My name is Robert Collins, I live in Lake Davidmouth, and my phone number is 857-700-6886x74972.

Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .,"My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel).",positive,"My name is Daniel Gross, I live in New Chelseaville, and my phone number is 001-602-874-5123x46654.

Works as expected,"I've had no problems running this with my Dell 8200 PC running Windows XP Home Edition which is running an addon USB 2 card, to which this hub (I have the 8 port version) is connected. When I bought it a year ago, I thought that 8 ports would be overkill and that 4 would be adequate, but I bought this unit anyway. Boy was I glad, right now 6 of the 8 are in use.",positive,"My name is Veronica Parker, I live in Lake Roger, and my phone number is (217)518-1448x9225.
