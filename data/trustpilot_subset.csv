"Although the Live Chat Customer Service staff are pleasant, the online interface is completely incorrect, so you never know how much is owed, they charge late payment fees when you are in fact, in credit, and I spend hours of my life trying to ascertain the position. Such a shame as it looks like its the tech thats letting them down",1
Amazing juicer nana J2 and wonderful service,1
We had some minor miscommunication problems but in a long run - everything was good.,4
KeananB was very helpful in answering what may have seen to someone else as a “silly” question but I really needed some clarification. I am grateful for his patience and kindness. ,5
"Really friendly staff, were happy to accommodate my request that the Zappi charger I was getting installed was set up so that my solar/battery install wouldn't drain into the car. All works brilliantly - can run my house off solar + battery while the car charges from the grid. Highly recommended. Thanks Connor!",5
